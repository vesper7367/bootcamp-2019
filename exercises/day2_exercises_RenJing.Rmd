```{r global_options, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=answers, eval=answers,
                      warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
                      cache = FALSE, tidy = FALSE)
```


## Load the data

Read both California energy datasets. Make sure the `datetime` variable is in an appropriate data type (i.e. not character). 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(reshape2)
generation <- read.csv(here::here("data/ca_energy_generation.csv"), stringsAsFactors = F )
imports <- read.csv(here::here("data/ca_energy_imports.csv"), stringsAsFactors = F)
```

```{r}
generation <- mutate(generation, datetime = as_datetime(datetime))
imports <- mutate(imports, datetime = as_datetime(datetime))
```


## Merge and reshape the data

Merge the two datasets and then melt the resulting dataframe/datatable to make it tidy.

```{r}
merged_energy <- merge(generation, imports, by = "datetime")
#merged_energy
```

```{r}
long_generation <- melt(merged_energy, id.vars = "datetime",
                                        variable.name = "source",
                                        value.name = "output")
long_generation
```


## Creating new variables

Create a series of new variables: 

1. `day`, which is the year-month-day, without the hour. The `lubridate` function `as_date` will do this.
2. `log_output`, which is the natural log of the output.
3. **Challenge**: `per_output`, which is the percent of daily output represented by each observation. You will need to use `group_by` and to create a new variable with the total output for the day. (Make sure to use `ungroup()` after this!)

Bonus: If you are using `dplyr`, try to do this all in one pipe!

```{r}
long_generation %>% 
    mutate(day = as_date(datetime), log_output = log(output)) %>%
    group_by(day) %>% 
    mutate(per_output = output/sum(output, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    select(day, log_output, per_output) %>% head()
```


## Summarizing and analyzing data

1. Which source has the greatest mean output by hour? (Hint: Use the `dplyr` verb `arrange(desc(variable))` to order the data frame so that the largest value of `variable` is first. Don't use `desc` and it arranges in ascending order. The `data.table` function is `setorder`.) Which has the least?
```{r}
long_generation %>% 
    group_by(source) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hourly = mean(output, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(mean_hourly))
```

```{r}
long_generation %>%
  group_by(source) %>%
  summarize(mean_hourly = mean(output, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(mean_hourly)
```

2. Which source has the greatest mean output by day? Which has the least? (Do not include zero values.)
```{r}
long_generation %>%
  filter(output>0) %>% 
  group_by(as_date(datetime), source) %>%
  summarize(mean_daily = mean(output, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_daily))

long_generation %>%
  filter(output>0) %>% 
  group_by(as_date(datetime), source) %>%
  summarize(mean_daily = mean(output, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(mean_daily)
```


3. Which sources has the greatest variance in usage over the course of a dataset? Which has the least? (Do not include zero values.)

```{r}
long_generation %>%
  filter(output>0) %>%
  group_by(source) %>%
  summarize(sd_output = sd(output, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sd_output))

long_generation %>%
  filter(output>0) %>% 
  group_by(source) %>%
  summarize(sd_output = sd(output, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(sd_output)
```


## Analyzing renewable versus non-renewable energy sources

The dataset `regroup.csv` has information about which sources are considered renewable by the state of California. Use this dataset, along with yourdata manipulation skills, to explore the use of renewable and non-renewable sources. Annotate what your descisions for the analysis.

Hint: Use your merge skills to merge the CA energy data with the `regroup` data. Which variable should you join by?

```{r}

```
